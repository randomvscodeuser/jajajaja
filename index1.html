            <p class="font">Rabbits are so cute, especially when they are small! Don't you agree? They are little furballs that are so cute and make a good pet. It is very easy to take care of and are just so CUTEE (≧∇≦) When I was in Korea, I went to this island called Nami Island and there were rabbits everywhere! Also, my sister even caught one and I got to pet it! I have a few photos of them</p>
